    *  Another option to store the weights is to define an Edge class and have each 
    *  edge store the name of the target node and weight of the edge.

    *    be copying entries from the <code>costs</code> map.
    *  - Loop thru the <code>costs</code> map's entry set:

    *       - Add the current entry if the list is empty or if the cost of the current entry
              equals the cost of the items in the list
    *       - Clear the list and then add the current entry if the cost of the current entry 
    *         is less than the cost of items in the list:
    *  - Sort the list first by costs and then alphabetically using a Comparator
    *    You can either implement the compare() method in the SortByCosts class
    *    or in a lambda expression that you write in the call to the sort method.
    *  - Return the name of the first node in the list
